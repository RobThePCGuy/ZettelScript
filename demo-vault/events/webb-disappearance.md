# Webb Disappearance

The unexplained disappearance of [[Dr. Sarah Webb]] from [[New Meridian]] three weeks after the [[Cascade Event]].

**Last Seen**: Clock Tower in [[Old Town]]
**Status**: Missing, presumed alive

[[Sofia Reyes]] believes Sarah is hiding in [[The Underground]] with evidence against [[The Syndicate]]. [[Elena Vance]] received an encrypted message that may have been from Sarah.

[[Marcus Chen]] claims she fled due to guilt over her role in the [[Cascade Event]], but records show she opposed the project.
