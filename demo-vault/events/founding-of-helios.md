The establishment of the [[Helios Institute]] in [[New Meridian]], secretly funded by [[The Syndicate]].

**Date**: 2018
**Key Figures**: [[Marcus Chen]] (appointed Director)

The institute was created to continue research into [[Quantum Resonance Theory]] that began decades earlier in [[Old Town]]. [[Elena Vance]] was recruited the following year.
