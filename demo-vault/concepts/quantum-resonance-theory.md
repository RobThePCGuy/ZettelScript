# Quantum Resonance Theory

A theoretical framework developed by [[Elena Vance]] proposing that quantum states can be synchronized across macro-scale distances through specific frequency patterns.

The theory is implemented through the [[Resonance Chamber]] at the [[Helios Institute]]. [[Dr. Sarah Webb]] warned that the mathematics predicted catastrophic instability at high energy levels.

The [[Cascade Event]] proved her warnings correct. [[The Syndicate]] has been researching this theory since experiments in [[Old Town]] decades ago.

Research continues despite the disaster, suggesting applications beyond what [[Marcus Chen]] has disclosed.
