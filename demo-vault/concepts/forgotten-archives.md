# The Forgotten Archives

A hidden repository of documents beneath the old library in [[Old Town]], [[New Meridian]].

Contains evidence of:
- Pre-war [[Quantum Resonance Theory]] experiments
- [[The Syndicate]]'s founding documents
- Original research that led to the [[Helios Institute]]
- Correspondence between early researchers and [[Marcus Chen]]

Discovered by [[Sofia Reyes]] during her investigation. [[Elena Vance]] believes the archives contain the key to understanding what really happened during the [[Cascade Event]].

[[Dr. Sarah Webb]] referenced these archives in her suppressed papers.
