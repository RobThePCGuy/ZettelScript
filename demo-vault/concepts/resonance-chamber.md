# Resonance Chamber

A massive experimental apparatus at the [[Helios Institute]] designed by [[Elena Vance]] to test [[Quantum Resonance Theory]].

**Specifications**:
- 30 meters in diameter
- Requires 4.7 gigawatts at peak operation
- Contains proprietary frequency modulators

The chamber was the epicenter of the [[Cascade Event]]. [[Marcus Chen]] approved its construction despite [[Dr. Sarah Webb]]'s safety concerns.

Post-incident analysis by [[Sofia Reyes]] suggests the chamber was modified beyond [[Elena Vance]]'s specifications. [[The Syndicate]] may have installed additional components.
