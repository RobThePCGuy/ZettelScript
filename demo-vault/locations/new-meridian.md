# New Meridian

A sprawling metropolis built on the ruins of the old coastal city. Home to the [[Helios Institute]] and approximately 4 million residents.

Districts:
- **Downtown**: Corporate headquarters, including [[The Syndicate]]'s front companies
- **[[Old Town]]**: Historic district with hidden secrets
- **[[The Underground]]**: Subterranean network beneath the city

The [[Cascade Event]] affected a 12-block radius in the eastern sector. [[Sofia Reyes]] is investigating the aftermath.
