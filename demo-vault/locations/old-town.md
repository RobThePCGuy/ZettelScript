# Old Town

The historic heart of [[New Meridian]], predating the modern city by centuries. Narrow streets and crumbling architecture hide many secrets.

Notable locations:
- [[The Forgotten Archives]] - hidden beneath the old library
- The Clock Tower - where [[Dr. Sarah Webb]] was last seen

[[Sofia Reyes]] discovered evidence linking [[The Syndicate]] to pre-war experiments conducted here. The connection to [[Quantum Resonance Theory]] predates the [[Helios Institute]] by decades.
