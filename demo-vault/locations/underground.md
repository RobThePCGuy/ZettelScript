# The Underground

A vast network of tunnels, bunkers, and forgotten infrastructure beneath [[New Meridian]].

Used by:
- Refugees from the [[Cascade Event]]
- [[The Syndicate]] for covert operations
- Possibly [[Dr. Sarah Webb]] as a hiding place

[[Elena Vance]] believes the tunnels contain evidence of earlier [[Quantum Resonance Theory]] experiments. [[Sofia Reyes]] has been mapping the network.
