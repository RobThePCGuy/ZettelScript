# Blackwood University

Prestigious institution where [[Elena Vance]], [[Marcus Chen]], and [[Sofia Reyes]] first met as students.

[[Dr. Sarah Webb]] was reassigned here after her warnings about [[Quantum Resonance Theory]] were ignored. The physics department maintains archives related to early resonance research.

The university's connection to [[The Syndicate]] through research grants remains a subject of [[Sofia Reyes]]'s investigation.
